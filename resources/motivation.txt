title Motivation
contents I applied for this role as since graduating with an MSc in GIS I have been working on mostly non-geographic data projects. Whilst this has enabled me to develop key software development competencies and learn new languages, I am looking for a role which will allow me to fully utilise my skillset. /n As the climate warms, the innovative and forward thinking work that start-ups do is vital for aiding global leaders in meeting the Climate Goals set out in the Paris agreement. I think that the work earthwave is doing/has done in this field is fantastic. For example, the CryoTEMPO-EOLIS which produces monthly DEMs over the Greenland ice sheet, is a great product for monitoring year round changes in the ice sheet. /n I would love to work for a company where I can be involved in all aspects of systems development from back-end database design to system documentation explaining how a product works. It would be amazing if I could use the skills I developed during my MSc thesis, and I apply them to real world problems and more mature data pipelines. /n I think that working at Earthwave would really suit my skills, interests and passion for spatial data and software development. I hope that you will consider me for this role.
