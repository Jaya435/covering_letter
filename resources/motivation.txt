title Motivation
contents I applied for this role as since graduating with an MSc in GIS I have been working on mostly non-geographic data projects. Whilst this has enabled me to develop key software development competencies and learn new languages, I am looking for a role which will allow me to fully utilise my skillset. /n As the climate warms, the innovative and forward thinking work that start-ups do is vital for aiding global leaders meet the Climate Goals set out in the Paris agreement. I think that the work earthwave is doing/has done in this field is fantastic. For example, the CryoTEMPO-EOLIS which produces monthly DEMs over the Greenland ice sheet, is a great product for monitoring the year round changes in the Greenland ice sheet.
