title Introduction
contents I currently work as a Technical Associate for a Digital Transformation specialist consultancy called Informed Solutions. Prior to this, I completed the Edinburgh University Geographical Information Science MSc, and graduated in 2019. For my research paper, I investigated the effectiveness of a Convolutional Neural Networks built with PyTorch for identifying land-use type. Specifically, I built a binary classifier to see where buildings were or were not. My motivation for this was that as long as you had High Resolution training data, the same method could be applied any type of land-use. For example, identifying where a landslide had occurred. /n I believe that I am an ideal candidate, as my passion for development and my technical background in Geographical Information Systems combined with my experience in the development industry and consultancy world has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in this role.
